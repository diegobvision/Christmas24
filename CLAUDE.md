## Design system

### Christmas colour palette

| Variable | Hex | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `$red` | `#C41E3A` | Primary CTA buttons, sale badges, accents |
| `$red-dark` | `#9B1530` | Hover state for red buttons |
| `$green` | `#165B33` | Navbar background, headings, borders |
| `$green-mid` | `#1E7A45` | Hover states, scrollbar |
| `$gold` | `#D4AF37` | Logo accent, dividers, hero CTA |
| `$gold-light` | `#F0D060` | Hover gold, snowflake tints |
| `$cream` | `#FAFAF0` | Page background |
| `$charcoal` | `#1A1A1A` | Body text |

### Breakpoints (defined in `_mixins.scss`)

| Mixin | Range |
|---|---|
| `@include xs` | < 480px |
| `@include sm` | 480–767px |
| `@include sm-down` | < 768px |
| `@include md` | 768–1023px |
| `@include md-down` | < 1024px |
| `@include md-up` | ≥ 768px |
| `@include lg` | 1024–1279px |
| `@include lg-up` | ≥ 1024px |
| `@include xl` | ≥ 1280px |

### Key mixins

- `@include container` — max-width 1280px, centred, with responsive padding
- `@include btn-primary` — red filled button
- `@include btn-secondary` — green outlined button
- `@include btn-gold` — gold filled button
- `@include card` — white card with hover lift shadow
- `@include heading-xl/lg/md` — Playfair Display responsive headings

## Environment variables

All three must be in `.env.local` (never committed):

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=christmas-shop-24-2.myshopify.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-public-token-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_NAV_COLLECTIONS=tree-decorations,gifts,stocking-fillers
```

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix is required on all three — cart mutations run client-side so the vars must be browser-accessible.
- The Storefront token comes from **Shopify Admin → Sales channels → Headless → Storefront API → Public access token**.
- Collection values are URL handles (e.g. `tree-decorations`), not titles. Find them under **Search engine listing** on each collection page in Shopify Admin.

---

## Shopify integration

- **API version:** `2024-10`
- **Endpoint:** `https://${domain}/api/2024-10/graphql.json`
- **Auth header:** `X-Shopify-Storefront-Access-Token`
- All queries and mutations live in `src/lib/shopify.ts`
- Cart ID is stored in `localStorage` under the key `shopify_cart_id`
- Collections are auto-populated in the navbar by reading `NEXT_PUBLIC_NAV_COLLECTIONS` — add a handle to that env var and it appears in the nav automatically, no code changes needed

### Storefront API scopes required

- `unauthenticated_read_product_listings` (covers products and collections)
- `unauthenticated_read_product_inventory`
- `unauthenticated_read_product_tags`
- `unauthenticated_write_checkouts`
- `unauthenticated_read_checkouts`
- `unauthenticated_read_content` (blogs and articles)

### Blog (Shopify Blogs & Articles)

- Powered by Shopify's native blog — articles are written in **Shopify Admin → Online Store → Blog posts** and appear on the site within a minute (ISR).
- Queries in `src/lib/shopify.ts`: `getArticles(first)` (latest N from the first blog), `getArticleByHandle(blogHandle, articleHandle)`, `getBlogHandles()`. The `Article.author` field is queried via `authorV2` (the non-deprecated field), aliased to `author`.
- `getArticles` reads from the **first blog only** (`blogs(first: 1)`) — the store currently has a single blog (`news`).
- Article URLs are `/blog/<article-handle>` — the blog handle is not in the URL. The article page resolves the owning blog internally by looping over `getBlogHandles()`, since article handles are unique within a blog.
- All articles are pre-rendered at build time via `generateStaticParams`; new articles published after a deploy are still served on demand thanks to ISR.
- The listing page's tag filter is purely client-side (in `BlogClient.tsx`) and only renders if articles have tags.

---

## Key patterns & conventions

- **Server vs client split:** data fetching always happens in server components (`page.tsx`, `Navbar.tsx`, `FeaturedCollection.tsx`). Interactive UI is split into a paired `*Client.tsx` file.
- **SCSS modules:** every component has a colocated `.module.scss` file. Global styles and the design system only live in `src/styles/`.
- **ISR revalidation:** all server pages use `export const revalidate = 60` (1 minute).
- **Images:** all product images come from `cdn.shopify.com`, whitelisted in `next.config.ts`.
- **`@/` path alias** maps to `src/` — use it everywhere instead of relative imports.
